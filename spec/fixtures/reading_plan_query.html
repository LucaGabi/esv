Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10002023-1">23&nbsp;</span>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was.

 <p id="p10002024.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10002024-1">24&nbsp;</span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner.

Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10002027-1">27&nbsp;</span>And Joab said, &#8220;As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10002028-1">28&nbsp;</span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p>
 <p id="p10002029.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10002029-1">29&nbsp;</span>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah.

And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <span class="verse-num" id="v10002031-1">31&nbsp;</span>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men. <span class="verse-num" id="v10002032-1">32&nbsp;</span>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</p>

<p id="p43012020.05-4"><span class="verse-num" id="v43012020-4">20&nbsp;</span>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. <span class="verse-num" id="v43012021-4">21&nbsp;</span>So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, &#8220;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43012022-4">22&nbsp;</span>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. <span class="verse-num" id="v43012023-4">23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012024-4">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012025-4">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012026-4">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also.

 <h3 id="p43012027.01-4">The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up</h3>
<p id="p43012027.09-4"><span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012027-4">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">&#8220;Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? &#8216;Father, save me from this hour&#8217;? But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012028-4">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Father, glorify your name.&#8221;</span> Then a voice came from heaven: &#8220;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43012029-4">29&nbsp;</span>The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, &#8220;An angel has spoken to him.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43012030-4">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;This voice has come for your sake, not mine.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012031-4">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012032-4">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43012033-4">33&nbsp;</span>He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. <span class="verse-num" id="v43012034-4">34&nbsp;</span>So the crowd answered him, &#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43012035-4">35&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012036-4">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3 id="p43012036.17-4">The Unbelief of the People</h3>
<p id="p43012036.22-4">When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. <span class="verse-num" id="v43012037-4">37&nbsp;</span>Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, <span class="verse-num" id="v43012038-4">38&nbsp;</span>so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p>
<div class="block-indent">
<p class="line-group" id="p43012038.13-4">&#8220;Lord, who has believed what he heard from us,<br />

 <p class="same-paragraph" id="p43012039.01-4"><span class="verse-num" id="v43012039-4">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,</p>

<span class="indent"></span>and hardened their heart,<br />
lest they see with their eyes,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>and understand with their heart, and turn,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>and I would heal them.&#8221;</p>
</div>
 <p class="same-paragraph" id="p43012041.01-4"><span class="verse-num" id="v43012041-4">41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43012042-4">42&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; <span class="verse-num" id="v43012043-4">43&nbsp;</span>for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.</p>
 <h3 id="p43012044.01-4">Jesus Came to Save the World</h3>
<p id="p43012044.07-4"><span class="verse-num" id="v43012044-4">44&nbsp;</span>And Jesus cried out and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012045-4">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012046-4">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012047-4">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012048-4">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012049-4">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment&#8212;what to say and what to speak.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43012050-4">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And I know that his commandment is eternal life.
